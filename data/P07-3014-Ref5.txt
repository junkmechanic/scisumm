Modifier-noun phrases are often used interchangably with paraphrases which contain the modifier and the noun joined by a preposition or simple verb.
The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds.
For our experiments we used the set of 600 labeled noun-modifier pairs of Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003).
The joining terms used for the experiments in this paper were chosen by examining which phrases most commonly occurred between two nouns in the BNC.
The SVM algorithm produced the best accuracy of all, achieving 50.1% accuracy using the combined set of joining terms.
